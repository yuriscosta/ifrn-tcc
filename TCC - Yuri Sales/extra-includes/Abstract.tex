	\begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
		With the popularization of \textit{Bitcoin} and others cryptocurrencies, online exchange offices have been emerging so that users can buy, store, transact and operate in the market their digital coins.
Due to this increase in the supply of exchanges and currencies, it is possible to develop market strategies to buy and sell in different places between different cryptocurrencies; and a way to facilitate this process is by automating itself.
Such automation can be conceived through the development of applications which consume the exchange offices \textit{APIs}.
These \textit{APIs} still lack information consistency, quality, support materials and they are full of restrictions. Due to this immaturity, developers find it difficult to work with these \textit{APIs}. 
This paper aims to perform a comparative analysis of the six main digital currencies exchange offices using as a parameter the development standards and the \textit{API} design good practices, also checking their limitations and documenting the results in order to assist others developers.
